# Deep-Pixel-wise-Binary-Supervision
Anti-Spoofing for Face Recognition task using the Deep Pixel-wise Binary Supervision Technique

This is a Project only to learn and implement the DeePixBiS model, from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04047v1.pdf

I have used PyTorch and OpenCV to implement the model. This project was heavily derived and inspired from https://github.com/voqtuyen/deep-pix-bis-pad.pytorch

The Trained model is already up saved as './DeePixBiS.pth' file which can be run on the model.
